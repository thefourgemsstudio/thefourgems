          <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
          <p>We collect only the data necessary to provide core game functionality, process purchases, and show ads. Data types include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Data</strong> — Google Play Billing processes in-app purchases. We collect purchase tokens and history of owned items (e.g., “remove ads”). We never collect payment card information.</li>
            <li><strong>User Identifiers</strong> — Google Play Games account ID used for login and cloud save.</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase History</strong> — stored to restore previous purchases.</li>
            <li><strong>Device & Technical Data</strong> — device identifiers, OS version, crash logs (for security and analytics).</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising & Analytics Data</strong> — advertising ID, approximate location, and app interaction data, used by Google AdMob for ads and analytics.</li>

            <li><strong>Analytics</strong> — understand how users play, improve performance and stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing and ads</strong> — show ads (personalized if you consent) and measure ad performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Fraud prevention & security</strong> — prevent abuse of purchases and unauthorized access.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>3. Data sharing</h2>
          <p>We do not sell or share your data with independent third parties. Data is only shared with trusted service providers necessary to run the game:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> — processes payments, provides purchase history.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Games</strong> — login and cloud save services.</li>
            <li><strong>AdMob / Google Ads</strong> — ads, analytics, approximate location, and device identifiers.</li>

            <li>Limit ad tracking via your device settings (Android settings → Privacy → Ads).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For players under 13 (or under the applicable minimum age in your country), Google automatically limits data collection and disables personalized advertising. 
In such cases, only non-personalized ads may be displayed.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>5. In-app purchases & payments</h2>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
          <p>We keep data only as long as necessary to provide the service (e.g., purchases, saved progress). Aggregate and anonymized analytics may be stored longer for statistics.</p>

          <p>The Four Gems is designed for players aged <strong>9 and older</strong>. 
          The game is not intended for children under this age rating, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 9.

          <p>Advertising in the game is provided through <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. All ads shown comply with Google’s policies for child-appropriate content. 
          If you are under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your country), personalized ads are automatically disabled by Google.</p>
